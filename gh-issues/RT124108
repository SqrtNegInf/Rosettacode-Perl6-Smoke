say [max] 1..(1+2**15); # ok

say 1+2**16; # this is one above the limit
#say [max] ([max] $_ for (1..(1+2**16)).rotor(2**16 - 1, :partial)); # work-around of sorts (obsolete)

#say [max] 1..(1+2**16); # bad, but an own goal
say max 1..(1+2**16); # works just fine

# improved error message reads: Too many arguments in flattening array.
