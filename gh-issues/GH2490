hope you don't mind that I'm the relayer of all this bad news about bugs
but it stands to reason that when you're treading close to the edge on performance issues
you might find that the code is a little bit fragile
but I think everyone appreciates that you're going for the one P6 feature everyone wants -- more speed
so keep on trucking, yours is no disgrace

my %h; %h<d s> = 42, 47; dd %h;

my @b; @b[0]<a> = 42; @b[0]<b> = 47; dd @b; # this is fine

my @a; @a[0]<a b> = 42, 47; dd @a; # this stopped working

# and now for something completely different...
# use @(@c[0]) for hard ref or @::(@c[0]) for symbolic ref
#@{$a[0]}{qw<a b>} = (42, 47)
