say [+] map * ** 2, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9;

# If this expression seems puzzling, note that * ** 2 is equivalent to {$^x ** 2}— the leftmost asterisk 
# is not the multiplication operator but the Whatever star, which specifies currying behavior.
# Another convenient way to distribute the exponentiation is via the cross metaoperator, which
# as a list infix is looser than comma in precedence but tighter than the reduction list operator:

say [+] 3,1,4,1,5,9 X** 2;
