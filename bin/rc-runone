#  only called from rc-moar/rc-jvm, to allow proper handling of 3 streams of output:
#    $ARGV[0] names the R.C. task, and 'rc-capture' bundles the task STDOUT/STDERR into one stream, this program's STDOUT
#    'time' prints to STDERR, becomes this program's STDERR

print `bin/rc-capture time $ARGV[0]`;
#print `Capture time $ARGV[0]`;
