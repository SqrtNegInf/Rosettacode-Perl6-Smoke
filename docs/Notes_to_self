Now I remember why I stopped testing JVM... 
After doing 'make install', edit both <jvm-master/install/bin/{perl6-j,perl}>, need to remove dozens of spurious 
instances of <${NQP_HOME}> on the line defining NQP_JARS, do: s/..NQP_HOME//g

2019-10-20
Back to JVM testing as well.
Using JDK 13: must remove '-noverify' option to 'java'

2019-10-18
Linux smoke-testing 99% finished

2019-10-15
header for Raku on RC language comparison page?
! {{anchor|Raku|[[Raku]]}} ({{anchor|Raku|[[formerly&nbsp;Perl&nbsp;6]]}})

2019-10-14
Put off .js testing, but got serious about smoke-testing on Linux

2019-10-13
Tomorrow: Perl 6 --> Raku 
One small lexicographical shift for a language, one giant logistical PITA for mankind!

2019-10-03
Looking at adding Rakudo.js to testing system.
(that segfault seems to have solved itself with MoarVM update)

2019-09-23
Trying to track down segfault in 'P/Palindromic_dates', slow going... Only small % of runs crash

2019-09-22
simplify all instances <join('')> construction, and <join '', blah>
Does it count if ':from<Perl5>' does 99% of the job?  I think not.
mark more tasks as 'ignored' (in 'rc-task-status')

2019-09-19
Yes, 'P/Palindromic_dates', with annotations for Oscar

2019-09-11
Palindromic dates?

2019-09-09
When upgrading Perl, check up on Inline::P5 as part of the process

2019-09-08
When something like this comes up: 'rm -rf ~/.perl6/precomp'
Missing or wrong version of dependency 'src/Perl6/World.nqp'

2019-08-25
Summer break over, back-filling stuff I've missed

2019-07-30
Hey, haven't any Out-of-sync/braid errors in a long time.

2019-05-16
Cleaned out all instances of [min] and [max], and alliteratively annotated on RC

2019-05-15
Lots of failed programs due to b9f899541b3f153ea73, needed to remove ~/.perl6/precomp

2019-04-29
DNS_query generated a transient error? (not the Out-of-sync/braid one):
    Type check failed in binding to parameter '$bufsize'; expected Cool but got Any (Any)

2019-04-27
And the continued-fraction variant stunned the assembled masses into utter silence...

2019-04-25
Ramanujan finally on RC (to universal acclaim)

2019-04-24
Updated modules (now that outage is over) and fixed two resulting regressions 

2019-04-20
thundergnat++ provides huge efficiency gains for Ramanujan (and found tpyo)

2019-04-19
Re-use code, re-use bugs...  But "Ramanujan's constant" draft in decent shape now.

2019-04-17
D'oh! Was not on HEAD, so not seeing GH2788/GH2805 fixes. Keep on eye on build version!

2019-04-16
For the '--target=' problem, opened issue, GH2843

2019-04-14
In a few instances, the use of .= to dispatch a mutating method must not be white-space separated from args, why?
100_doors
Loops_Foreach
Password_generator

2019-04-12
"perl6 --target=ast" hangs for these (tries to generate entirety of large/infinite 'constant' value?)
Bernoulli_numbers
Catalan_numbers_Pascal%27s_triangle
Find_palindromic_numbers_in_both_binary_and_ternary_bases

2019-04-01
Collecting stats on the 'Out-of-sync package' problem. It's rare. Between smoke-test and code-health
checks, ~2000 runs/day of P6 code, and in March it happened < 10 times.  Also: appears random.

2019-01-09
Now that was a pretty bad bug (GH2593), not the first found via RC tasks, but the worst.

2019-01-08
Move tasks to alphabetical sub-directories. Github unhappy with too many files in one directory.

2018-12-09 
That was a bear, results worse not better. No more JVM testing for now. Is it even viable long-term?

2018-12-05
Flushing out concurrency: MacOS very sensitive, on Linux best to have low free memory. Either there's
a bug in the code or there isn't: resource starvation doesn't make them spontaneously generate.

2018-11-29
Going down the rabbit-hole with concurrency issues/testing. Mac vs Ubuntu, how to trigger, etc.

2018-10-18
'Law_of_cosines_-_triples' continues to amuse. Fix concurrency problems with atomic ops.

2018-09-06
Excited to add task (Law_of_cosines_-_triples) with nested 'X' operators... But thundergnat++ shoots 
it down, as hugely inefficient (sad but true).  

2018-05-22 
Busy day, 1267 commits... Less here than meets the eye, these are merge commits generated by 
'git-smoker-faker' (see in 'bin') to correctly place by date all previous RC updates (as documented 
in my custom headers, which I was pretty religous about).

2018-01-18
Hash-randomization upgrade requires some fixes (more in testing than in code).

2018-01-01
Think most of the GLR bugs are now gone? Continue and attain 100% coverage?  Sure, why not.

2017-08-13
'Random' results flip and flip again? Hope this stops soon, tests go south each time.

2015-10-11
Fixed HTTP task. Little did I know what this would lead to...
