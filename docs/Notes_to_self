Same suite of tasks failing (some run, memory use grows without bounds); solved by nuking just ~/.raku/precomp/*

2020-03-25
Duly assigned as GH3750, and lizmat tagged as 'edge cases', 'weird' -- I thought that's what Raku is for ?!?

2020-03-24
The 'lazy list' issue not going away, need to work up a GH issue for it

2020-03-21
Perl6 --> Raku fixes done, except maybe for a few over-looked items

2020-03-16
vim support: remove syntastic, update vim-perl6 with vim-raku (mostly just a name change at this point?)

2020-03-15
Fixing Perl6 --> Raku links by hand is tedious and time-consuming and blessedly far-removed from current events

2020-03-14
Only minor adjustments needed for Perl6/Raku rename; modified template to use '/usr/bin/env raku', but not globally changing old tasks

2020-03-12
General failure of precomp, tried to solve by nuking again, as below, but probably should have just waited for the code fix

2020-03-09
Procrastinated for years (OK, >= decade), but moving from tcsh (to zsh) wasn't that big a deal in the end

2020-03-05
Seattle goes viral.  Programming will resume after I finish up hoarding canned goods...

2020-03-03
Output for .gist of Set* Bag* changed for a few tasks, just cosmetics

2020-03-02
Many tasks failing, in many ways; solved by nuking both ~/.raku/precomp/* and 'moar-blead'

2020-02-27
Another run at */×; barest beginnings of the project front-page

2020-02-26
Using Telemetry/snapper to find which tasks are memory-hogs.

2020-02-25
Looks like 'rakubrew' is the little build-chain thread that you start pulling on...

2020-02-22
Windows: not as bad as it used to be (but still a slog to get stuff done)
Working towards setting up RC smoke-testing...

2020-02-21
Continued work with 'rakubrew': different failure on MacOS, Windows 10 failed due to whitespace (in my fracking account name)

2020-02-14
Testing on Ubuntu VM finally in place (well, 99% done)

2020-02-13
.pick/.roll bug fixed, but for testing must revise output on all affected programs
Since the fix was in MoarVM (MoarVM#1238) presumably this won't affect JVM results?

2020-02-12
More tool-chain fun: 'rakubrew' should not be using 'Application Support', too many issues with '3rdparty' tools

2020-02-11
As distributed App::Rakubrew won't work on older MacOS (fails at least up to 10.13, 'High Sierra') 
because of library issue (chkstk_darwin) but if built locally with 'pp' it's OK

2020-02-09
Tweaks to get Ubuntu testing to work

2020-02-06
the new libtommath is screwing up srand-locked random results

2020-02-03
Aha: stale Inline::Perl5 file in 'lib' was blocking use of 'Math::AnyNum'

2020-02-02
zef install Math::Libgsl::* needs GSL header files which 'ports' doesn't supply 
(and maybe other problems too, 2.3 vs 2.5; maybe mostly for Linux at this point?)

2020-01-29
This did not do the trick, so just copied 'Type.pm' to 'lib'.
zef --force-test --force-install install https://github.com/pierre-vigier/Perl6-Math-Matrix.git
p.s. on 2020-02-13: missing library files added in a few days ago, so problem solved 

2020-01-27
git glitch, rename Möbius_function to 'Moebius_function'

2020-01-26
How about this as a style (particularly for computation/math-heavy) code: 
    skip the sigils for scalars, but keep them for arrays and hashes

2020-01-24
Extensive munging of 'Simulated_annealing' task planned, keep notes to jusify...

2020-01-21
With regard to white/black squares in 'P/Peaceful_chess_queen_armies':
rypervenche: you can use <?{ … }> to check whether the match is an element of the set. 
chloeke:     See https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Regex_boolean_condition_check
chloeke:     my %symbol := set('!' .. '~'); say '!a~å' ~~ m:g/.<?{~$/ (elem) %symbol}>/

2020-01-20
Finally done with administrivia for JVM smoke-test, and some further task-status munging (e.g. M/Magic_square* for P6, P5)
Found 1 more task, previously failing, that became functional.

2020-01-16
Situation with JVM is fairly static: nothing broke that was working, but only 1 task that previously failed became functional.
Why?? Abelian_sandpile_model and Guess_the_number_With_feedback_player consume little CPU, are only crawling towards completion...

2020-01-15
Running JVM for the first time in a long while... (man is it slow)

2020-01-14
Math::Matrix borked, but moving soon: https://github.com/lichtkind/Raku-Math-Matrix, so wait and see...

X/XML_Validation works again, installation of module was *very* slow, and reported:
[LibXML] # Running libxml2 version: 2.09.02 (module 0.2.7)
[LibXML] # ***NOTE was configured against libxml2 version 2.9.10 ***

Fails to install, but no consequences: 
    IO::Socket::Async::SSL:ver<0.7.5>  (used only by 'Cro:HTTP'/URL_shortener, which isn't being smoke-tested)
    DBIish (maybe drop from Zef-install-all, as it causes a long hang?)

2020-01-13
Can't use perl6-debug-m, 'Circular module loading detected trying to precompile', trying new rakudobrew/raku

2020-01-12
Looking at output from 'rc-parse-dump', but not as much detailed info. as AST gives

2020-01-11
AlexDaniel swears by: https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github

2020-01-10
fgrep 'call &infix:<*>' ast/* | word | uniq | less
'×' to-do: (all done!)

2020-01-09
'A' was very math-heavy, but no show-stoppers came up.

2020-01-08
'*' in Raku code stands for a lot of things that are not multiplication, so why overload it, use '×' instead?
Trying this in [0-9A]/*. Not riding this hobby-horse all the way to RC though, except for any new code added.

2020-01-06
Oops, yesterday's fiddle messed up several tasks for JVM testing.  Using .1 kludge for these now.

2020-01-05
Rakufy: .perl -> .raku (when should be this be done on RC?)

2020-01-04
Trivial but annoying: fixed 'blank' lines to become true paragraphs

2020-01-03
X/XML_Validation now has errors? Skip for now.

2019-12-17
MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 36905824 in GC work pass

2019-12-15
perl6 -c U/Unprimeable_numbers gave: MoarVM panic: Internal error: invalid thread ID 81405 in GC work pass

2019-12-14
Can change classify --> categorize, but not always the reverse? (e.g. see S/Sexy_primes vs K/Kosaraju)

2019-12-12
"Got it in my head that {$scalar}s would not interpolate into quoted strings, but not {1==1} except for disambiguation or code execution."

2019-12-09
Hate linked lists, skipping those tasks for now.

2019-11-24
With some recent tasks, esp. 'Names_to_numbers', starting to see the benefits of the Raku regex design.
Next stop: grammars.

2019-11-14
Right, that was a learning experience: 'm:nth' is work-alike for P5-style 'global' matching in a 'while' loop
(see: F/Functional_coverage_tree-1, P/Peaceful_chess_queen_armies).  Turns out, you can learn a lot when you RTFM...

2019-11-10
Will rally to the butterfly flag, port some P5 to Raku...

2019-11-02
Those timing tests on Top-swops: revealed that P6 concurrency developed a bug versus old Mac OS X in early 2018.
Not present in Linux, and probably not in recent MacOS releases.

2019-10-25
Contents of 'lib' is just-enough-module-code to gets JVM tasks running. May well be incomplete or out of date...

2019-10-24
JVM can be fast! Comparable to P5/ntheory for some of the prime-manipulation tasks

2019-10-22
Now I remember why I stopped testing JVM... 
After doing 'make install', edit both <jvm-master/install/bin/{perl6-j,perl}>, need to remove dozens of spurious 
instances of <${NQP_HOME}> on the line defining NQP_JARS, do: s/..NQP_HOME//g

2019-10-20
Back to JVM testing as well.
Using JDK 13: must remove '-noverify' option to 'java' (or see a future-proofing warning repeatedly)

2019-10-18
Linux smoke-testing 99% finished

2019-10-15
header for Raku on RC language comparison page?
! {{anchor|Raku|[[Raku]]}} ({{anchor|Raku|[[formerly&nbsp;Perl&nbsp;6]]}})

2019-10-14
Put off .js testing, but got serious about smoke-testing on Linux

2019-10-13
Tomorrow: Perl 6 --> Raku 
One small lexicographical shift for a language, one giant logistical PITA for mankind!

2019-10-03
Looking at adding Rakudo.js to testing system.
(that segfault seems to have solved itself with MoarVM update)

2019-09-23
Trying to track down segfault in 'P/Palindromic_dates', slow going... Only small % of runs crash

2019-09-22
simplify all instances <join('')> construction, and <join '', blah>
Does it count if ':from<Perl5>' does 99% of the job?  I think not.
mark more tasks as 'ignored' (in 'rc-task-status')

2019-09-19
Yes, 'P/Palindromic_dates', with annotations for Oscar

2019-09-11
Palindromic dates?

2019-09-09
When upgrading Perl, check up on Inline::P5 as part of the process

2019-09-08
When something like this comes up: 'rm -rf ~/.perl6/precomp'
Missing or wrong version of dependency 'src/Perl6/World.nqp'

2019-08-25
Summer break over, back-filling stuff I've missed

2019-07-30
Hey, haven't any Out-of-sync/braid errors in a long time.

2019-05-16
Cleaned out all instances of [min] and [max], and alliteratively annotated on RC

2019-05-15
Lots of failed programs due to b9f899541b3f153ea73, needed to remove ~/.perl6/precomp

2019-04-29
DNS_query generated a transient error? (not the Out-of-sync/braid one):
    Type check failed in binding to parameter '$bufsize'; expected Cool but got Any (Any)

2019-04-27
And the continued-fraction variant stunned the assembled masses into utter silence...

2019-04-25
Ramanujan finally on RC (to universal acclaim)

2019-04-24
Updated modules (now that outage is over) and fixed two resulting regressions 

2019-04-20
thundergnat++ provides huge efficiency gains for Ramanujan (and found tpyo)

2019-04-19
Re-use code, re-use bugs...  But "Ramanujan's constant" draft in decent shape now.

2019-04-17
D'oh! Was not on HEAD, so not seeing GH2788/GH2805 fixes. Keep on eye on build version!

2019-04-16
For the '--target=' problem, opened issue, GH2843

2019-04-14
In a few instances, the use of .= to dispatch a mutating method must not be white-space separated from args, why?
100_doors
Loops_Foreach
Password_generator

2019-04-12
"perl6 --target=ast" hangs for these (tries to generate entirety of large/infinite 'constant' value?)
Bernoulli_numbers
Catalan_numbers_Pascal%27s_triangle
Find_palindromic_numbers_in_both_binary_and_ternary_bases
Floyd%27s_triangle
Lucky_and_even_lucky_numbers
Ludic_numbers

2019-04-01
Collecting stats on the 'Out-of-sync package' problem. It's rare. Between smoke-test and code-health
checks, ~2000 runs/day of P6 code, and in March it happened < 10 times.  Also: appears random.

2019-01-09
Now that was a pretty bad bug (GH2593), not the first found via RC tasks, but the worst.

2019-01-08
Move tasks to alphabetical sub-directories. Github unhappy with too many files in one directory.

2018-12-09 
That was a bear, results worse not better. No more JVM testing for now. Is it even viable long-term?

2018-12-05
Flushing out concurrency: MacOS very sensitive, on Linux best to have low free memory. Either there's
a bug in the code or there isn't: resource starvation doesn't make them spontaneously generate.

2018-11-29
Going down the rabbit-hole with concurrency issues/testing. Mac vs Ubuntu, how to trigger, etc.

2018-10-18
'Law_of_cosines_-_triples' continues to amuse. Fix concurrency problems with atomic ops.

2018-09-06
Excited to add task (Law_of_cosines_-_triples) with nested 'X' operators... But thundergnat++ shoots 
it down, as hugely inefficient (sad but true).  

2018-05-22 
Busy day, 1267 commits... Less here than meets the eye, these are merge commits generated by 
'git-smoker-faker' (see in 'bin') to correctly place by date all previous RC updates (as documented 
in my custom headers, which I was pretty religous about).

2018-01-18
Hash-randomization upgrade requires some fixes (more in testing than in code).

2018-01-01
Think most of the GLR bugs are now gone? Continue and attain 100% coverage?  Sure, why not.

2017-08-13
'Random' results flip and flip again? Hope this stops soon, tests go south each time.

2015-10-11
Fixed HTTP task. Little did I know what this would lead to...
