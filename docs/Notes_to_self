Collecting stats on the 'Out-of-sync package' problem. It's rare. Between smoke-test and code-health
checks, I do 2000 runs/day of P6 code, and in March it happened < 10 times.  Also seems random.

Now that was a pretty bad bug (GH2593), not the first found via RC tasks, but the worst.

2019-01-08
Move tasks to alphabetical sub-directories. Github unhappy with too many files in one directory.

That was a bear, results worse not better. No more JVM testing for now. Is it even viable long-term?

Flushing out concurrency: MacOS very sensitive, on Linux best to have low free memory. Either there's
a bug in the code or there isn't: resource starvation doesn't make them spontaneously generate.

Going down the rabbit-hole with concurrency issues/testing. Mac vs Ubuntu, how to trigger, etc.

'Law_of_cosines_-_triples' continues to amuse. Fix concurrency problems with atomic ops.

Excited to add task (Law_of_cosines_-_triples) with nested 'X' operators... But thundergnat++ shoots 
it down, as hugely inefficient (sad but true).

Busy day, 1267 commits... Less here than meets the eye, these are merge commits generated by 
'git-smoker-faker' (see in 'bin') to correctly place by date all previous RC updates (as documented 
in my custom headers, which I was pretty religous about).

Hash-randomization upgrade requires some fixes (more in testing than in code).

Think most of the GLR bugs are now gone? Continue and attain 100% coverage?  Sure, why not.

2017-08-13
'Random' results flip and flip again? Hope this stops soon, tests go south each time.

Fixed HTTP task. Little did I know what this would lead to...
