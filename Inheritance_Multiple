say my $r1 = CameraPhone.^mro;     # undefined type object
say my $r2 = CameraPhone.new.^mro; # instantiated object

CameraPhone() Camera() MobilePhone() Any() Mu()

The .^mro is not an ordinary method call,
but a call to the object's metaobject
that returns the method resolution order for this type.
