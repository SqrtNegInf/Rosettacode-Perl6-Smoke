# Perl 6 has a built in method .getc to get a single character from an open file handle. File handles default to UTF-8, so they will handle multi-byte characters correctly.
# To read a single character at a time from the Standard Input terminal; $*IN in Perl 6:

#.say while defined $_ = $*IN.getc;

# Or, from a file:
my $filename = 'ref/test.txt';
 
my $in = open( $filename, :r ) or die "$!\n";
 
my @res.push: $_ while defined $_ = $in.getc;

.say for @res;

my $ref = qq:to/END/;
