# Some explanation: S:g[...] = ... is a global substitution that returns its result. % is an anonymous state variable in which we cache any results of a prompt using the //= operator, which assigns only if the left side is undefined. slurp reads an entire file from STDIN or as named in the argument list.

print S:g[ '<' (.*?) '>' ] = %.{$0} //= prompt "$0? " given slurp;
