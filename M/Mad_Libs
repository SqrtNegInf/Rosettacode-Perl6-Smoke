# Some explanation: S:g[...] = ... is a global substitution that returns its result. % is an anonymous state variable in which we cache any results of a prompt using the //= operator, which assigns only if the left side is undefined. slurp reads an entire file from STDIN or as named in the argument list.

my $story = '<name> went for a walk in the park. <he or she> found a <noun>. <name> decided to take it home.';

say my $result = S:g[ '<' (.*?) '>' ] = %.{$0} //= prompt "$0? " given $story;

use Test;
is $result, 'Oscar went for a walk in the park. he found a giraffe. Oscar decided to take it home.';
